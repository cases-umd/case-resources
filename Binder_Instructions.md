# Binder Instruction

To create an interactive Jupyter notebook link for a given GitHub repository, please follow below steps: 

* The binder does not install any advanced libraries required to run the code successfully, e.g: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc
* Hence, your GitHub repository should contain a requirements.txt file alongwith the the Jupyter notebook CASE file
* You can check a similar requirements.txt file at: https://github.com/mjha07/IntrotoDataScience/tree/master/Homework1
* Now go to Binder Hub and enter your GitHub repository url: https://mybinder.org/
* Once you have clicked launch, Binder Hub creates a docker image of your repository and generate a binder url 
* Copy the url generated in the textbox and you are ready to share your intercative notebooks with others

To run the interactive Jupyter notebook, please follow below steps: 

* Go to the url generated by binder
* Open a terminal window, using the "New" button
* Run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Once the required libraries are installed successfully, launch the Jupyter notebook
